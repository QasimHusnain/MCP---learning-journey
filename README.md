My notes and pracitce while learning MCP
# HTTP - hyper text transfer protocol
 **A protocol** is just a set of rules that computers follow to talk to each other.

- Human analogy: if I say “Hello” and you reply “Hi,” we both followed the rule of greeting.

- Computer analogy: if a browser sends GET /index.html, the server replies with the HTML page.

👉 So: ***Protocol = language + rules + order of conversation.***
Important parts:

1. Methods: GET (read), POST (send data), PUT (update), DELETE (remove).

2. Status codes: 200 (OK), 404 (not found), 500 (server error).

3. Headers: metadata (like sender info, content type).

4. Body: actual data (HTML, JSON, image, etc.).
